Chicago has several different transit APIs, which each have different syntaxes.
The CTA bus and train trackers are well documented, but the Divvy Bike API is poorly documented.
PACE buses have no official API, but data can be pulled from their bus tracker.

I thought it would be helpful to have a repo with different scripts for pulling Chicago-area transit APIs.
My intent is to help people who want to use those APIs by giving a starting point for code that pulls the APIs and turns them into useful output.

The CTA's APIs require API keys, which can be obtained from the follwing links:
https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/
https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/ttdocs/
These links also contain documentation for each of these APIs.
